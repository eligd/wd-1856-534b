# WD 1856+534 b

## Overview
This repository contains the code to accompany our study of exoplanet WD 1856+534 b. We have reduced and fit lightcurves to 16 transit observations obtained with the 1m Nickel Telescope at Lick Observatory. We used the resulting midtransit times to follow up on preliminary evidence of orbital decay in this system, but ultimately found that orbital decay is not needed to explain the observations. Lastly, we have studied data from [INSERT DISCUSSION OF OTHER DATA SOURCES].

## Transits
We observed 16 transits of WD 1856+534b with the 1m Nickel Telescope at Lick Observatory on the following dates. We used 45 second exposures in the R band for all transits except the April 2022 transits, which were taken in the V band.
