# A giant planet candidate transiting a white dwarf
- Paper link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2713-y
- Radial velocity measurements not possible because WD spectrum is featureless
- Thermal flux from planet constrained to less than 6.1% of WD's thermal flux by comparing optical and infrared spectra
- Known white dwarf binaries typically explained by common envelope evolution (companion engulfed by red giant, spirals inward, but can eventually eject envelope and stop moving inward if it has sufficient gravitational potential energy), but WD 1856+534 b probably would not have had enough gravitational potential energy available to avoid falling onto the host star because of its low mass and long orbital period
- WD 1856+534 b discovered in TESS data, but due to limited spatial resolution and cadence (and the WD being fairly faint for TESS) it is hard to make precise measurements of the planet's properties using TESS data
- WD 1856+534 physically associated with M-dwarf pair
- Fit atmosphere model (specifically Hydrogen to Helium ratio) to Pan-STARRS and 2MASS photometry and Gaia parallax; found that 50/50 H/He atmospheric composition fits data best
- Linear Orbits for the Impatient (LOFTI) used to model orbits of WD 1856 and G 229-20 A/B (M dwarves) about common center of mass
- Fit transit parameters using MCMC (code is available online if we want to compare it to our MCMC approach)
- To test dependence on limb-darkening coefficients, MCMC fits were rerun with limb-darkening coefficients as free parameters; no significance differences were observed compared to the original fit
- MESA used to model the relationship between WD 1856+534 b's age, mass, temperature, etc.
- Constraining system age
    - System must be younger than the age of the universe and older than the WD cooling age (around 5.85 Gyr)
    - System age is roughly the sum of the progenitor age and the WD cooling age, but it is challenging to estimate the progenitor age because (a) there could have been mass transfer or common-envelope evolution and (b) the progenitor age is very sensitive to the (not yet well-constrainted) WD final mass
- M dwarves G 229-20 A/B unlikely to perturb WD 1856+534 b onto sufficiently eccentric orbit for high-eccentricity tidal migration to move it from an initial orbital distance of at least 1 AU to its present orbital distance of 0.02 AU
- On the other hand, additional planets in the system *could* perturb WD 1856+534 b onto a sufficiently eccentric orbit
- Timescale for orbit to circularize after high-eccentricity tidal migration is found to be less than the system's age
- Other possible (but unlikely) explanations for small orbital distance: stellar flyby, galactic tides, tidal dissipation in host star's red giant phase, scattering with another planet near periastron that resulted in ejection of other planet, partial tidal disruption
