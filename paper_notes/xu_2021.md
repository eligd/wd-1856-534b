- Atmospheric pollution of WD is a sign that WD accreted planets during red giant phase (but WD 1856+534 is not polluted)
- WD mass difficult to constrain without radial velocity measurements, which are not possible because the WD spectrum is featureless
- WD 1856+534 in triple star system
- Transmission spectra: light from star passing through planet's atmosphere during transit
- Vanderburg discovery paper assumed 50/50 Hydrogen/Helium atmosphere based on lack of H $\!\alpha$ in spectrum, but later spectra revealed H $\!\alpha$ lines
- Spectral energy distribution (SED) and H $\!\alpha$ feature better explained by H atmosphere model than by Vanderburg's mixed H/He atmosphere model
- Produce light curves from time-series spectra
    - White light curves: sum over all wavelengths
    - Spectroscopic light curves: separate lightcurves for each spectroscopic bin
- For each light curve, fit midtransit time, $R_p/R_s$, and $b$ with fixed stellar mass, radius, and limb darkening parameters; then fit phase-folded light curve to improve $R_p/R_s$ and $b$ measurements
- Implications of planet being larger than star:
    - $(R_p/R_s)^2$ is *not* equal to the transit depth
    - Different regions of planet's atmosphere are responsible for observed transmission spectra at different points in transit
- Proposed solution for grazing transits: limb-darkening corrected, time-averaged transmission spectrum
- WD 1856+534 b atmosphere probably similar to Jupiter: spectrum dominated by CH4, NH3, and H2O
- No spectral features observed, possibly because of clouds in planet's atmosphere or because planet mass is larger than expected
- Spectra consistently drop around 0.55 μm, which could be due to emission in planet's atmosphere (why emission and not absorption?)
- Better constraints on WD 1856+534 b's mass will help distinguish between possible formation mechanisms
