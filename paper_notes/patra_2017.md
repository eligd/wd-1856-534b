# The Apparently Decaying Orbit of WASP-12b

- Most hot Jupiters should be undergoing orbital decay because star's rotational angular momentum is generally too small in comparison to orbital angular momentum for tidal evolution to reach stable equilibrium
- Hot Jupiters with sufficiently eccentric orbits should undergo apsidal precession
- Under orbital decay model, can constrain $Q_*$ from $dP/dt$, $M_p/M_*$, and $R_*/a$
- Under apsidal precession model, can constrain Love numper $k_p$ (which describes how centrally concentrated the planet's mass is) from $d\omega/dE$, $M_*/M_p$, and $R_p/a$
