- Detecting light from exoplanet easier around white dwarf (WD) because host star is relatively faint
- Planet and WD expected to have comparable brightness in mid-infrared
- JWST MIRI data collected on 2024-07-29 (*not* during transit)
- JWST pipeline yielded "nonuniform background structure" in MIRI images, so the authors reprocessed the data with MEOW (https://github.com/kevin218/Magic)
- Model WD's spectral energy distribution (SED) using physical parameters from MacDonald et al. JWST observations (which I haven't been able to locate)
- Perform aperture photometry on MIRI data and subtract expected WD flux to compute planet's flux excess
- Flux excess observed at 12.8, 15, and 18 μm
- Infrared features in WD spectrum not seen in NIRSpec data and thus not expected in MIRI data
- Alternative explanations for observed IR excess (debris disk, cmpanions, spatially unresolved background source) all considered unlikely
- Estimate blackbody temperature of planet as $186^{+6}_{-7}$ K
- Can also use JWST data for atmospheric modeling and compute planet temperature from there, but due to limited quantity of data so far the atmospheric modeling does not offer a significant advantage over the blackbody model
- Estimate planet's mass as $5.2^{+0.7}_{-0.8}$ Jupiter masses from temperature of planet and age of system, which confirms WD 1856+534 b is an exoplanet rather than a brown dwarf
- WD 1856+534 b is sufficiently close to WD that it would have been destroyed during red giant phase if it was so close in at the time (i.e., lies in "forbidden zone")
